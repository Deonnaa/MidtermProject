## Quorum

#### Mid-term Team Project for Skill Distillery

### Overview
Quorum is a social media platform designed for students. Its goal is to connect students attending the same school.

### Description
Quorum has multiple avenues of social interaction, involving `posts` and `private messages`. After creating an account and selecting the school you attend, you will be given a surplus of actions.
    As a user, you can:
        * Update your profile
        * Search any content within your school
            * including professors, students, and groups
        * Join social groups started by other students
        * Create posts to those groups or start your own
        * Follow and Unfollow other students as well as Removing Followers from your page.
        * Enroll or Remove active classes from your schedule
            * _this is purely a social action, to show friends your schedule_
        * Send or Recieve `Messages` to and from other users at your school
        * Leave a review for current instructors at your school
